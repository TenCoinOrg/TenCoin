- **Smallest Unit:** `Teno` (8 decimals, like satoshi)  
- **Total Supply:** `10,000,000 TEC`

## Key Features
- **UTXO-based transaction model** for transparency and security.  
- **Timer and verify-code scripts**: conditional execution stored at the script level.  
- **Single transaction fee**: standard fee paid to miners, no additional completed_fee.  
- **Multisig & advanced scripts**: supports timelock, multisignature, and custom conditions.  
- **P2P network** with dedicated ports:
  - Mainnet: `10110` (P2P), `10111` (RPC)
    
- **JSON RPC API**: compatible with standard wallets like Trust Wallet.  
- **Cross-platform nodes**: lightweight nodes can run autonomously, even on limited hardware.

## Technical Details
- **Consensus:** PoW.
- **Halving:** every 100,000 blocks, initial block reward 50 TEC.  
- **Transaction Fees:** only a standard fee paid to miners.  
- **Script behavior:** timer or verify-code conditions stored at the output script level; executed when conditions are met.  
- **Refunds or conditional unlocks:** handled via script execution rules, fully deterministic.
